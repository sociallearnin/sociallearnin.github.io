    <P>
    Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding,
     while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic 
     has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temper
     atures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environme
     tal change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinc
     t. Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, 
    some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, oce
    an acidification and sea level rise.</P>

  <P>  In india this climate change is seen very seriously.The climate of
     India consists of a wide range of weather conditions across a vast geographic scal
     e and varied topography. Based on the KÃ¶ppen system, India hosts six major climatic sub typ
     es, ranging from arid deserts in the west, alpine tundra and glaciers in the north, and humid tropic
     al regions supporting rain forests in the southwest and the island territories. Many regions have starkl
     y different microclimates, making it one of the most climatically diverse coun
     tries in the world. The country's meteorological department follows the international standard
      of four seasons with some local adjustments: winter (December to February), summer (Marc
    h to May), monsoon or rainy season (June to September), and a post-monsoon period (October and November).

<P> There are many factors for this climate change, some of them are-



</P>
<ol>
 <li>
        Pressure 
</li> 

<li>
        Relief Features, Latitude, Ocean Currents
</li>

<li>Wind Systems, Altitude

</li>

 <li>
    Distance from the Sea (Continentality)
</li>

</ol>
<span>the main  factor for this climate change is the humans cutting trees and wiping out the vegetation's. </span>
