     indles, solid white and dalmatian-type spotting are never seen in pure populations. These may be a sig

     gs have been introduced.[15]

     of equal or slightly greater length than the head. The neck

      nimally angled. The trot is short. The eyes are 
    almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The ears are held erect and are pointed
     at the tips, with a broad base, set low on the head, and
      the tail is curled and held high when excited.</P>

 dogs are those dogs who are produced by some people for the purpouse of selling only.
These dogs are forced to have sex and given various injections for the same. Only thier parent
s dont get pain,these dogs are often very weak and are affected by the diseases very easily.Some
